# Why single .h files?

As what https://github.com/nothings says: Why not two files, one a header and one an implementation? The difference between 10 files and 9 files is not a big deal, but the difference between 2 files and 1 file is a big deal. You don't need to zip or tar the files up, you don't have to remember to attach two files, etc.

I agree with his view point, and am probably sticking with the single .h file(s) unless my views change, which could happen, i'm rather open minded.
